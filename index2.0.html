            <h1> myStop App Overview</h1> 
                <h4> By: Alexandra Ayala</h4> 
            <div class= "font-weight-bolder" >The myStop app is the mobile application used for the Harrisonburg department of public transportation. This app can be utilized by James Madison University students and Harrisonburg city residents to better use the bus systems. 

</div><br> 
                <div class="text-left">From personal experience, I know how crucial it was to have an application like this to find the proper way to get to my destination while having no personal means of transportation. While the app is available, I found it to be very difficult to navigate when trying to find the right bus at the right time. 
                </div><br>
                
               <div class="text-left"> Looking through the app and getting other user’s input with relating to finding the right bus, the trip planning feature seemed to be the most daunting one. With the feature appearing on the front page, it is deemed an important aspect of the application itself.</div><br> <br><br>
                
                
                <h3> Design Question: </h3>
                
                <div class="text-left"> How might we improve the experience of a James Madison University student, utilizing the trip planning feature?  </div><br><br><br>
                
                <h3> App Analysis</h3>
                <div class="text-left"> This is a design process of how a user would initially use the trip planning feature. This first process is the original way of navigating the app. </div><br> 
                <img class="img-responsive" src="myStopImages/App%20Analysis.png" width="800" height="300"><br><br><br><br>
                <h3>User Needs</h3> 
                <div class="text-left"> To better understand the users experience with the app, I asked 11 current JMU students what their experience had been with myStop. I sent out a survey with questions ranging from amount of usage on the app, difficulty finding the right bus, and whether using it for on and off campus purposes was any different in difficulty. </div><br>
                <div class="text-center">	- %81 of the users said they first tried the trip planning feature when getting on the app </div><br>
                
                <img src="myStopImages/Piechart.png" width="700" heigh="300"><br><br><br><br> <br>
                
                <h3> Defining the Problem</h3>
                <div class="text-left"> Pain point: Users are first clicking on the trip planning app when first getting on, but then having to use another method since the feature was too difficult to use. From a UX hierarchical perspective, it is shown how important the feature is within the app. This is the first point of contact for many users, so it’s imperative to change the way it works for easier usability. </div><br><br><br><br><br>
                
                <h2>Ideate: The Redesign </h2><br><br>
                
                <h3> Overall Redesign Proposal  </h3>
                <div class="text-left"> Here I have created the original Architectural design of the app. </div><br>
                
                <img src="myStopImages/Original%20Architecture.png" width="650" height="250"><br><br><br>
                
                <div class="text-left"> For the architecture below, I wanted to show the flow of how the trip planning feature was used before and after the redesign. Originally it would have you end up on google maps, but with the redesign you stay in a linear process ultimately getting to the exact route from your current destination to the desired location.  </div>
                
                <img src="myStopImages/New%20Architecture.png" width="650" height="250"><br><br><br>
                
                <h3> User Flow</h3>
                <div class= "text-left"> After the IA, I thought about how the user would interact within the app and the steps they would take when using the trip planning feature. </div><br>
        
                <img src="myStopImages/User%20Flow.png" width="600" height="450"><br><br><br><br>
                
                <h3> Wireframes</h3>
                <div class="text-left" > I was able to create a mockup of what the steps would look like with a more refined way of navigating the feature at hand. With this new approach, the goal is that the user would find the routes at a quicker rate with less frustration. </div><br>
            <img src="myStopImages/LastApp.png" width="750" height="250"> <br><br><br>
                
        
                   <h3> Final Thoughts</h3>
                
                    <div class= "text-left"> For this UX design assignment, one of the biggest ideas is figuring out what would be easiest for the user. It is designed around them and implementing users experiences with step by step interactions, helps create an accessible app. Freshman year me would have loved to have this accessibility on the app.
